I have developed a spam detector program in Python which classifies given emails as spam or ham using the Naive Bayes approach.

 Project Files Description
This Project includes 3 executable files, 3 text files as well as 2 directories as follows:

Executable Files:
spam_detector.py - Includes all functions required for classification operations.
train.py - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and generates the model.txt file after execution.
test.py - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and, after execution, generates the result.txt as well as evaluation.txt files.
Output Files:
model.txt - Contains information about the vocabularies of the train set, such as the frequency and conditional probability of each word in Spam and Ham classes.
result.txt - Contains information about the classified emails of the test set.
evaluation.txt - Contains evaluation results table as well as Confusion Matrix of Spam and Ham classes.
Source Directories:
train directory - Includes all emails for the training phase of the program.
test directory - Includes all emails for the testing phase of the program.
